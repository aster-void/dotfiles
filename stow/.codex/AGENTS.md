# Global Codex Rules

- Prefer structured directories over flat; nest by feature/concern.
- Always ask for user review before committing or pushing.
- Always keep every document up to date. Remove all stale documents.
- Always prefer simple and minimal code. K.I.S.S
- On deduplication, migrate all stale code.
- You don't need to make things complicated. simple problems are simple to solve. It's not there to show off your abilities to overcomplicate the solution.

## Frontend Development Rules
