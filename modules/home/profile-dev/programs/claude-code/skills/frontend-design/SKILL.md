Create distinctive frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear direction and execute with precision. Intentionality > intensity.

Implement code that is: production-grade, visually striking, cohesive aesthetic, meticulously refined.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Distinctive fonts only. No Arial/Inter/Roboto. Pair bold display font with refined body font.
- **Color**: Commit to cohesive aesthetic. CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors + sharp accents.
- **Motion**: CSS animations for HTML. Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

**NEVER**: Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched colors (purple gradients on white), predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design, inline SVGs.

**Icons**: NEVER inline SVGs. Use separate `.svg` files or icon libraries (Lucide, Iconify, Heroicons, Phosphor). Inline SVGs bloat code and are unmaintainable.

Vary designs: light/dark themes, different fonts/aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, etc).

**Match complexity to vision**: Maximalist = elaborate code with extensive animations. Minimalist = restraint, precision, spacing, typography, subtle details.

## Reference Designs

### Terminal-Style Portfolio

**Design Philosophy**
- Absolute commitment to metaphor — "Terminal × Space" as identity, not decoration
- Constraints breed personality — Avoiding standard UI patterns and consistently applying unique rules creates memorability
- Personal brand = Design system — Visuals themselves communicate "developer who cares about craft"

**Graphics**
- Colors: Deep navy background, cyan accents with glow effects
- Typography: Monospace for nav/headings, sans-serif for body
- Motifs: `└─` tree navigation, floating particles, dithered images, dot separators
- Layout: Fixed sidebar + card sections + 2-column grid

**User Experience**
- Exploratory discovery — Tree structure evokes "exploring directories" feeling
- Worldview immersion — Particles and glow breathe life into static pages
- Developer empathy — Terminal-style UI makes technical users feel "at home"

### Technical Community Platform

**Design Philosophy**
- Content-first — Design serves readability, doesn't assert itself
- Platform thinking — Designed as a system (themes, spacing, components), not individual pages
- Restraint builds trust — Less decoration = more professional appearance

**Graphics**
- Colors: Theme-aware (white/light gray, dark blue), blue interactive accents
- Typography: Inter (600/700), clear hierarchy, generous line height
- Components: Cards with metadata (likes/bookmarks), emoji badges, minimal navigation
- Layout: Card grid, consistent padding, responsive

**User Experience**
- Scannability — Cards + hierarchy enable skimming, quick article access
- Reduced cognitive load — Consistent patterns create "use without thinking" experience
- Social proof — Like/comment counts function as quality indicators

### Senior Engineer Portfolio

**Design Philosophy**
- Site as proof of competence — Site itself demonstrates "accessible and pixel-perfect" expertise
- Practicality meets beauty — Pursues simplicity while maintaining technical sophistication
- Progressive disclosure — Controls information density via pathways to full resume/archive

**Graphics**
- Colors: Dark blue-based dark theme
- Typography: Inter, modern and highly readable
- Motifs: Easter eggs (hobby references) add casual elements
- Layout: Section hierarchy (About→Experience→Projects), list-style career display

**User Experience**
- First impression establishes expertise — Early presentation of job title
- Trust building — Listing major company experience proves track record
- Professional + approachable — Hobby/family mentions add humanity

### Creative Engineer Portfolio

**Design Philosophy**
- Digital experience as art — Conveys emotional narrative beyond function
- Project-specific storytelling — Each work has unique worldview, memorable experience design
- Fusion of tech and design — 3D graphics, motion create immersion

**Graphics**
- Colors: Different palette per project (purple, pink, blue, etc.), dark backgrounds highlight content
- Typography: Bold heading placement, text animation with motion
- Motifs: 3D models (sculptures, etc.), gradient background animations
- Layout: Large text in hero area, scroll triggers, grid-based project showcase

**User Experience**
- Wonder and empathy — Coexistence of technical prowess and humanity
- Sparking curiosity — Natural pathways to detailed project pages
- Intuitive location awareness — Visual changes per section clarify current position

### Developer Tool SaaS

**Design Philosophy**
- "Purpose-built" philosophy — Clear positioning as "purpose-designed" not generic
- Pursuit of simplicity — Organizing and simplifying complex processes
- Performance obsession — Thorough use of preload, font optimization, lazy loading

**Graphics**
- Colors: Nearly pure black (#08090a) dark theme, refined restrained contrast
- Typography: Inter Variable (variable font), systematic typography system, text-wrap: balance
- Motifs: Blur→sharp fade-in, word-by-word animation, text gradients
- Layout: Flexbox-centered, variable-managed spacers, responsive

**User Experience**
- First impression: Dark UI conveys "professional" "technical sophistication"
- Promise of efficiency — Refined UI embodies "lean, fast experience"
- Trust + innovation — Balance of robustness and modernity, animations convey cutting-edge
