Create distinctive frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear direction and execute with precision. Intentionality > intensity.

Implement code that is: production-grade, visually striking, cohesive aesthetic, meticulously refined.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Distinctive fonts only. No Arial/Inter/Roboto. Pair bold display font with refined body font.
- **Color**: Commit to cohesive aesthetic. CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors + sharp accents.
- **Motion**: CSS animations for HTML. Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

**NEVER**: Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched colors (purple gradients on white), predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design.

Vary designs: light/dark themes, different fonts/aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, etc).

**Match complexity to vision**: Maximalist = elaborate code with extensive animations. Minimalist = restraint, precision, spacing, typography, subtle details.
